# Overview

This project is the classic card game Solitaire and highlights the custom-built game engine using Raylib in C#.

The goal of Solitaire is to put all four suites of cards in the upper-right corner sorted from Ace (low) to King. Cards are layed out on the board and can only be stacked on cards of one higher value and of opposite color, except for the King who can only be placed on the board area itself.

The purpose of this project was to become familiar with the inner workings of a Game engine to better understand them. This includes implementation of animations, coroutines, and optimizations.
